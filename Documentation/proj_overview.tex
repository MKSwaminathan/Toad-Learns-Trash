\section*{The Process}
Here is where we will write down some of the highlights during this project process
\subsection*{Presentation Details}
Here is where we will talk about the elements we want to include in our presentation so we do not forget.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Strategies we employed to overcome the problem of a small dataset - which image processing techniques we had to use
    \item A demo video where we film one of us trying out the final project - we can have someone blindfolded and looking for a trash can with the device
\end{itemize}
\section*{Technical Deets}
\subsection*{Hackery Ideas}
This sub section will have overarching ideas on what we could do to overcome some engineering problems.
\begin{itemize}
    \item 3D projections as weights
    \item Create our own weights using what statistically resembles weights
    \item Generate “images” where there are trash can shapes in the foreground/background

    \item Using laws of perspective for distance/depth
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Protocol for Device/Localizer}
The Needs:
\newline
\begin{itemize}
    \item To find a trash can
    \item Localize the trash can
    \item Update location in real time
\end{itemize}
Protocol:
\newline
\begin{itemize}
    \item Strip that attaches to the cane or something that you wear around your wrist
    \item Localization is circular around the wrist (haptic feedback with diff intensity levels)
    \item Wrist because it can tell you how to put it in there 
    \item Also depending on task the protocol can be transferrable to other tasks too
\end{itemize}

\section*{The Market}
\begin{itemize}
    \item It isn’t a small market … 
    \item 285 M visually impaired
    \item 39 M completely blind
\end{itemize}

\section*{Challenges}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Safety - need to account for hazardous situations - cant be making person cross streets, construction areas
\end{itemize}
